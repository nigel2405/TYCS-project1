# Login Issue After Password Reset - Debug Steps

## Current Status
‚úÖ Password reset is working correctly (frontend shows success)
‚ùå Login fails with 401 Unauthorized after password reset

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check Backend Console Logs
Look for these logs in your backend console during the login attempt:
```
üîç Login attempt for user: [email]
üîç Stored password hash: [hash]...
üîç Password match result: [true/false]
```

### 2. Use Debug Endpoint
Test the user's current state:
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/debug-user?email=YOUR_EMAIL
```

This will show if the password was actually updated in the database.

### 3. Test Different Scenarios

Try logging in with:
1. The NEW password (should work)
2. The OLD password (should fail)

### 4. Possible Issues

#### Issue A: Password Hash Mismatch
- The password was reset but there's a hash comparison issue
- **Solution**: Check bcrypt version compatibility

#### Issue B: User Record Not Updated
- The password reset appeared successful but didn't actually update the database
- **Solution**: Check database connection and transaction logs

#### Issue C: Multiple User Records
- There are duplicate user records, and the wrong one is being updated
- **Solution**: Check for duplicate users in database

#### Issue D: Case Sensitivity
- Email case mismatch between reset and login
- **Solution**: Ensure email comparison is case-insensitive

### 5. Quick Fix Test

Try this temporary fix - add case-insensitive email lookup in login:

```javascript
// In authController.js login function, change:
const user = await User.findOne({ email });

// To:
const user = await User.findOne({ 
  email: { $regex: new RegExp(`^${email}$`, 'i') } 
});
```

### 6. Manual Database Check

If you have MongoDB access, check:
```javascript
// Find the user
db.users.findOne({ email: "your-email@example.com" })

// Check if there are duplicates
db.users.find({ email: "your-email@example.com" }).count()
```

## Next Steps
1. Share the backend console logs from the login attempt
2. Try the debug endpoint
